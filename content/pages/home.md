# About me

I am a skilled Full Stack Developer with a wealth of diverse life and technical experience that I bring to every project.

I work quickly and effectively in getting things built and working across the stack.

I am an excellent communicator who thrives in bright and enthusiastic teams, and I'm also a self starter when working solo.

I know that the aesthetics of effective design combined with application speed, security and reliability combine to create a great user experience.

I work closely with clients to ensure their aims and expectations are met.
