So I've been studying with the Code Institute for about 6 weeks now, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it! It's so exciting to make websites and apps that I'm proud of and want to show off to everyone.

I come from a scientific background originally - I studied Natural Sciences at university and went on to become a Biology Technician in a college. Whilst I **LOVE** science and am still a major nerd, I found myself becoming less and less satisfied with my career progress. It was by chance that I stumbled upon coding, having a curiosity for it a few years ago but too intimidated to start! But once I gave it a go, I was instantly hooked. Furthermore, a career in coding is one that provides good prospects for career progression and is a constantly evolving field.

My course with Code Institute will train me to be a Full Stack Web Developer, which will equip me with the skills to make a website, and make the database that runs it. A jack-of-all-trades as it were! Hopefully this will stand me in good stead when the time comes to apply for jobs!
